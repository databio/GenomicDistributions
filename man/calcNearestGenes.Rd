\title{Find overlapping annotations for a given query and annotation
set. Annotate the query based on the distance to the nearest
gene, the gene name, and the gene type.}
\usage{
calcNearestGenes(query, annotations, removeUnknowns = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{A GRanges or GRangesList object with query sets}

\item{removeUnknowns}{Boolean value to indicate if you'd like to remove unannotaed ranges in the query.}

\item{annotatations}{A GRanges or GRangesList object with annotation sets}
}
\value{
A data table that contains observations for each genomic region
        and the associated aforementioned annotations.
}
