\name{calcOpenSignal}
\alias{calcOpenSignal}
\title{The function calcOpenSignal takes the input BED file(s) in form of GRanges 
or GRangesList object, overlaps it with all defined open chromatin regions 
across cell types and returns a matrix, where each row is the input genomic
 region (if overlap was found), each column is a cell type, and the value 
 is a normalized ATAC-seq signal.}
\usage{
calcOpenSignal(query, cellMatrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Genomic regions to be analyzed. Can be GRanges or GRangesList 
object.}

\item{cellMatrix}{Matrix with open chromatin signal values, rows are genomic
regions, columns are cell types. First column contains 
information about the genomic region in following form: 
chr_start_end. Can be either data.frame or data.table object.}
}
\value{
A data.table with cell specific open chromatin signal values for query 
regions.
}
