Title: Produces Summaries and Plots of Features Distributed Across Genomes
Description: If you have a set of genomic ranges, this package can help you with
 some simple visualizations. It produces several kinds of plots, for example:
 Chromosome distribution plots, which visualize how your regions are distributed
 over chromosomes; feature distance distribution plots, which visualizes how
 your regions are distributed relative to a feature of interest, like
 Transcription Start Sites (TSSs); genomic partition plots, which visualize how
 your regions overlap given genomic features such as promoters, introns, exons,
 or intergenic regions.
