Package: GenomicDistributions
Version: 1.1.9

Title: GenomicDistributions: fast analysis of genomic intervals with Bioconductor
Description: If you have a set of genomic ranges, this package can help you with
 visualization and comparison. It produces several kinds of plots, for example:
 Chromosome distribution plots, which visualize how your regions are distributed
 over chromosomes; feature distance distribution plots, which visualizes how
 your regions are distributed relative to a feature of interest, like
 Transcription Start Sites (TSSs); genomic partition plots, which visualize
 how your regions overlap given genomic features such as promoters, introns,
 exons, or intergenic regions. It also makes it easy to compare one set of
 ranges to another.
