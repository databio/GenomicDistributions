Title: Produces Summaries and Plots of Features Distributed Across Genomes
Description: If you have a set of genomic ranges, this package can help you with
 some simple visualizations. Currently, it can produce two kinds of plots:
 First, the chromosome distribution plot, which visualizes how your regions are
 distributed over chromosomes; and second, the feature distribution plot, which
 visualizes how your regions are distributed relative to a feature of interest,
 like Transcription Start Sites (TSSs).
