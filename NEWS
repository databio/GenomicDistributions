# Change log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Here we
will document changes to major new releases only (not point releases).

## [1.3.2] -- 2022-01-19
  - Bioconductor released new version
  - Cell specificity plots are now more generic signal summary plots - the calc function is now "calcSummarySignal", plot function "plotSummarySignal" 
  - Added calculation of Chi-square p-values of expected partitions as default output of "calcExpectedPartitionsRef"
  - Chi-square p-values are now optionally shown as stars on top of each partition output by "plotExpectedPartitions"
  - Chromosome distribution calculations have been optimized to substantially reduce running time 
  - Default plotting of neighbor distance now includes an X-axis log scale to account for outliers more intuitively 
  - Corrected plotting of partition overlap for multiple region sets - now sums to 100 by group
  - Intro vignette has been updated to include "calcSummarySignal" and "plotSummarySignal" functions along with expected partitions p-values calculation and updated X-axis scale of neighbor dist plots

## [1.1.2] -- 2020-07-07
  - Added functions to calculate and plot dinucleotide frequencies

## [1.1.1] -- 2020-06-03

  - Package now on Bioconductor under 1.0.0 (dev version 1.1.0) - bump to 1.1.1
  - Added sorting option to feature distance plot
  - Added stack bar option to partition plots
  - Fixed ordering of chromosome distribution
  - Added possibility to calculate proportional overlap in partition plots
  - Expected partition distribution now calculated based on annotation class object sizes
  - Improved definition of introns in gene partition lists
  - Improved memory and time performance
  - In full power vignette added option to add custom annotation classes in partition plots
  - Added functions to create annotations out of GTF files
  - New vignette - how to build custom reference data
