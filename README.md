# Genomic Distributions

Functions for calculating and plotting the distribution of query features (*e.g.* genomic ranges) across the genome. If you have a set of genomic ranges, the GenomicDistributions R package can help you with some simple visualizations. Currently, it can produce two kinds of plots: First, the chromosome distribution plot, which visualizes how your regions are distributed over chromosomes; and second, the feature distribution plot, which visualizes how your regions are distributed relative to a feature of interest, like Transcription Start Sites (TSSs).

## Installing
